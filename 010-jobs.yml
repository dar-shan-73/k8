### Job resource in kubernetes
# 1) You want some task should be executed at some time every day [ we can create a job and schedule it ]
# 2) We are internsted to load the schema every day 10 AM  [  we can create a job ]
# 3) I want some pod should run to send email for every 1hr.

# JOB: This is also a kubernetes wrapper, that provision a pod to execute some task and then goes to completed state and not like regular pods that runs forever.
# Deleting a Job will clean up the Pods it created.
# Suspending a Job will delete its active Pods until the Job is resumed again.
